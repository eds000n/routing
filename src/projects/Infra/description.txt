This is the INFRA SinalGo project.

In this project we have an INFRA implementation just like the Nakamura's thesis. The implementation 
provides the following features:

1 - Leader Election Algorithm
2 - Intra-cluster routing tree formation
3 - Inter-cluster routing tree formation
4 - Aggregation tree using the Aggregate Coordinator Distance
5 - Role migration
6 - Log generation similar to Nakamura's ns-2.27 implementation
7 - Perl and R scripts to generate graphics

2 - How to run INFRA
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are two different ways to run INFRA. The former is the interactive mode where one can run and
see the effects of the features listed above on the SinalGo visual environment. Hence, one can see 
two events and the clusters formations. A third event is schedule to apper after some simulation time.
When the simulation starts, the sink is depicted in red, the cluster head (Coordinators) in cyan 
and the clusters members (Colaborators) in green; the nodes that detects the events are in 
orange and after the cluster formation they change their color to green or cyan (depende on it's role). 
The black nodes are relay only and the yellow nodes are relay nodes that belong to the routing tree. 
Blue nodes were CH and looses this condition and are acting as a local CH now.
After the cluster formation  the sink floods the entire network and the routing tree 
is generated. Then, the collaborators starts  to transmit their data to sink through their 
correspondent clusters head and one can see  the role migration feature if it is necessary.
The second way is non-interactive and aims to collect the informations to generate the results graphics. 
Those graphfics are useful to compare different techniques and some parameters. A perl script is
available in the project root directory in order to automate the execution.
